# TV_script_generator--Udacity_Deep_Learning-Nanodegree
This is the 3rd project of the Deep Learning Nanodegree.

This project utilised a Recurrent Neural Network which was trained on scripts of a famous 90's sitcom tv series. The RNN utilised an embedding layer and its hyperparameters were tuned to a satisfying result.
Whole dialogues can be built (here between Jerry, Kramer, Elaine and George) although, subject to the training process, sometimes the meaning is not as expected..!

*jerry: oh, hi.*

*kramer: hey.*

*jerry: hi elaine. i can't believe you were going to have to be in your apartment. you know, i was just trying to get a little tired of a little bit about this.*

*jerry: what?*

*jerry: you know what you think?*

*elaine: what?*

*george:(looking at the tag) hey, i saw you in college with this...(he exits)*

*jerry: what?*

*george: well, i guess i don't know...(picks up a container of food) you know i can't afford this!*

*jerry: i don't want to go to the bathroom.*

*jerry:(to george) so?*

*elaine: oh yeah.(to jerry) oh, my god, i'm sorry...*

*jerry: i don't want to know.*

*george: i know. i just wanted to talk to you about it.*

*jerry:(to kramer) so you know, the whole thing is the best.*
